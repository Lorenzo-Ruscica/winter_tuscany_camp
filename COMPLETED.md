# Task Completed

The Newsletter feature has been upgraded.

## Critical Step Required
You **must** run the SQL script `get_all_emails.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor.
This creates a secure function that allows the admin panel to fetch **ALL** registered email addresses from the authentication system, not just those who have filled out the entry form.

## New Features
1.  **Full Email List**: Captures every registered user.
2.  **Recipient Preview**: A scrollable list in the admin panel shows exactly who will receive the email.

Open `walkthrough.md` for details.
